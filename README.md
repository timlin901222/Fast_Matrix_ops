# Fast Matrix Multiply
A light weight matrix multiply program written in C. Used advanced techniques such as 
- parallel programming (using OpenMP) 
- SIMD intrinsics (Single instruction multiple data) 
- advanced algorithms
- cache blocking 
to achieve a 70x speedup on matrix multiply and 720x speedup on matrix power.
